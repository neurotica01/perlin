Here's a detailed project spec for creating a rotating 3D Perlin noise terrain visualization:

PROJECT: 3D Perlin Noise Terrain Visualizer
STACK: React + TypeScript + Three.js + React Three Fiber + Simplex Noise

CORE VISUALIZATION CHARACTERISTICS:
- Black background
- Green wireframe rendering
- Continuous smooth rotation
- Isometric perspective
- Real-time rendered terrain based on 2D Perlin noise mapped to 3D space
- Client-side rendering

COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE:
```typescript
interface NoiseTerrainProps {
  resolution?: number     // Grid density (default: 50x50)
  rotationSpeed?: number  // Radians per frame (default: 0.01)
  noiseScale?: number    // Noise frequency (default: 0.05)
  height?: number        // Max terrain height (default: 10)
  wireframeColor?: string // (default: '#00ff00')
}

// Component hierarchy
NoiseTerrainViewer
  ├─ Canvas (R3F wrapper)
  │  ├─ Scene
  │  │  ├─ NoiseTerrainMesh
  │  │  │  ├─ Geometry 
  │  │  │  └─ Material (wireframe)
  │  │  └─ Lighting (optional)
  │  └─ Camera (isometric)
  └─ Controls (optional)
```

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:

1. BASIC SETUP
- Create React project with TypeScript
- Install dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber, simplex-noise
- Set up basic R3F Canvas with black background

2. NOISE GENERATION
- Create noise generation utility
- Map 2D noise to 3D vertices
- Generate grid geometry based on noise values

3. MESH & MATERIAL
- Create wireframe material
- Build mesh geometry from vertices
- Apply transformations for isometric view

4. ANIMATION & INTERACTION
- Implement rotation animation using useFrame
- Add optional camera controls
- Optimize performance with useMemo

5. REFINEMENTS
- Add props for customization
- Implement performance optimizations
- Add error boundaries and loading states

KEY TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Noise values need to be normalized to [-1, 1]
- Geometry should be centered at origin
- Camera position for isometric view: (distance, distance, distance)
- Need to handle component cleanup and buffer disposal
- Consider using BufferGeometry for performance
- May need debouncing for resolution changes

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Use instanced geometry for complex terrains
- Compute noise values in Web Worker
- Memoize static geometry
- Use buffer attributes for dynamic updates
- Implement level of detail based on viewport

POTENTIAL EXTENSIONS:
- Color gradients based on height
- Dynamic noise seed changes
- Multiple terrain layers
- Interactive rotation controls
- Export to GLTF/GLB
- Screenshot functionality

This spec should provide enough context to pick up development at any phase. Each section can be implemented independently, and the core visualization can be achieved by completing phases 1-4.

UGH ok 
short term todo:
- stash again. react component for controls. 
- remember that there's two canvas components.  what's up with that eh?
- then continuation
ideas:
- flying dot a .8 altitude.  crusing through the terrain. 
- fpv view?
- control of this guy?
- color gradient over time? moving through that graph
